   git clone https://github.com/glenrage/block-dex.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Run tests
   ```
   npm run test
   ```
4. Run Build
   ```
   npm run start
   ```
5. Open browser to localhost:3000

## Technical Decisions

1. Add Pokemon Feature - Since instructions were to NOT use the Pokedex API, my intuition tells me this feature should allow the user to custom add a new Pokemon that does not exist.
   - I created a reusable form component that utilizes React.Context so that the form may be used globally within the application without any parent-child dependency.
   - I stored the new pokemon data in localstorage, normally we would probably want to persist the data through a database layer, but in our case its temporarily stored on the client side.
   - New Pokemon data is retrieved through Context API
2. Error Handling - Main application error handling is handled through an Error Handler Higher order component. Network requests error handling is done via simple try catch blocks.
3. Testing - I added some Integration tests as I think they provide the most bang for buck when it comes to time allotted for writing tests
